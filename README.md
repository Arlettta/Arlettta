About me:

I am xtremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. What matters to me is meeting another person. People who I get to know inspire me and motivate to be creative and proactive. I am confident in my ability and passionate about working with people. For the last six years I have worked as an English teacher. At this point, I feel the need to take on new professional challenges. Thanks to my previous experience, I gained competences that can be valuable while performing tester’s duties, such as analytical skills, precision and inquisitiveness. That's why, I would like to develop myself in the area of software testing
